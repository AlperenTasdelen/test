In this chat, you and I are going to study and create a Database. We will use Java, Apache Solr, solrj library mainly. My database features are : NoSQL attributes included (column based), one Master (for now, we will add second one for replication and crash recovery), One TMCS that reads and writes freely, and we have logs which is a json and an object basically. I am using maven for configuration.
